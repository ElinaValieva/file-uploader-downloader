# :open_file_folder: File Manager

### Additional :bulb:

 - `H2 db` for saving file-info (file duration, token-key)
 - `File Collector`, for removing old files from repository
 - For `uploading`, set file duration and get token-key
 - For `downloading` set token-key

### Prerequsites :heavy_exclamation_mark:

 1. `JDK 1.8` at least - for running app
 2. `Maven 3+` - for building package

### Build and Deploy :hammer:

 1. Build both services by `mvn clean install`
 2. Go to `http://localhost:8090`
